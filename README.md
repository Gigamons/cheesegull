# CheeseGull

[ mascotte will go here once the guy on Fiverr does it ]

CheeseGull is the second version of the osu! mirror for Ripple. CheeseGull aims
to be **THE** mirror. This means that it will eventually have everything you
could expect of a mirror, including sharding, an API, and whatever you could
think of.

Currently very WIP, I'm hoping to get it to work by early 2017. Pull requests /
issues / whatever are accepted! This is not a mirror from a project on git.zxq.co.
